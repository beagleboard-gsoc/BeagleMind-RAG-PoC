Since that is an old kernel I would suspect it has been running perfectly until this point. Hence, might be the ram has an issue. It might have some logs that have now filled up all the emmc??? If you can jump start it on SD card and mount emmc then look around and see if that is filled up. This is just a guess, not having the board and intimate knowledge of the code makes this
